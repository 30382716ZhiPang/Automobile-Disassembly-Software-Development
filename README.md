# Automobile-Disassembly-Software-Development
## Abstract
The new energy vehicle project is an MR application developed based on the HoloLens 2 device and using the Unity engine and its Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK). The project aims to provide an interactive virtual environment that allows users to disassemble the car, change the exterior color, start the car and rotate the car through gestures.

Through interactive information displays, users can get more detailed instructions and introductions to individual car components or specific functions. This project aims to provide an immersive experience to help users better understand and explore the world of new energy vehicles.

### I.	PLUG-IN USAGE
This new energy vehicle project mainly uses Mixed Reality Toolkit (MRTK) for interaction. MRTK is a powerful toolkit designed for developing mixed reality applications, providing rich interactive functions and components.

With MRTK, projects can achieve intuitive interaction between users and virtual cars. Users can easily select, operate and disassemble various parts of the car using gesture recognition and voice commands on the HoloLens 2 device. MRTK provides rich gesture and voice input support, making the interaction process more natural and smooth.

### II.	MODEL PREPARATION
We are preparing a car model specifically designed for HoloLens 2 interaction, aiming to provide a rich and engaging experience for mixed reality applications in new energy vehicle projects. Users can interact with the virtual car through gestures, including dismantling the car, changing the color theme and other operations.

Users can select and disassemble various parts of the car through gestures, such as opening doors, adjusting seats, replacing wheels, etc. Such an interactive method will allow users to gain an in-depth understanding of the car's internal structure and working principles, and deepen their understanding of new energy vehicle technology.

In addition, users can also change the color theme of the car through the interactive interface or gesture operations. They can choose different exterior colors and paint schemes and preview the different looks of the car in real time. This will provide users with an experimental platform, allowing them to freely try and compare multiple designs in order to make the best choice.

### III.	FUNCTION DEVELOPMENT
The project will cover several key functions, including car disassembly, exterior color change, starting the car, and rotating the car.

First, we worked on enabling car disassembly capabilities. Users will be able to use gestures to select and disassemble various parts of the car, from the hood to the seats, from the tires to the lights. This will provide users with a unique opportunity to gain an in-depth understanding of the car's internal structure and mechanical working principles, and deepen their understanding of automotive technology.

Secondly, we will provide an exterior color changing function, allowing users to freely choose the exterior color and painting scheme of their car in an interactive manner. With an intuitive interface and real-time preview, users can try out different color combinations to find a personalized look that works best for them.

### IV.	EFFECT DEMONSTRATION
Users will be able to change the exterior color of their car through gestures. Users can use gestures to select different colors to apply to the car's body, roof, wheels and more. With real-time preview, users can immediately see the effect of color changes, allowing for personalized look customization.

Secondly, we will provide the function of car disassembly and assembly, and users can disassemble and assemble various parts of the car through gesture operations. For example, they can use gestures to open car doors, adjust seat positions, change tires, and more. This will provide users with an interactive learning platform, allowing them to gain an in-depth understanding of the internal structure and components of the car and deepen their understanding of automotive technology.

Through this gesture-based interaction method, we aim to provide an intuitive and natural experience that allows users to easily interact with virtual cars. There is no need for complex controllers or equipment, users can change the color of the car and disassemble the assembly simply by using gestures.

## PROJECT ENVIRONMENT
The development of HoloLens 2 requires the following software environments: Windows 10 Professional 64-bit, Windows 10 SDK, Visual Studio 2019 or higher, HoloLens 2 emulator, Unity development engine, and MRTK.

Install Unity. Microsoft's current recommended Unity configuration for HoloLens 2 Windows Mixed Reality is Unity 2020.3 LTS with the latest Mixed Reality OpenXR plug-in. To avoid known performance issues with earlier versions of 2020.3, Unity patch version 2020.3.8f1 or later must be used. This project is mainly developed using version 2021.1.19f1c1.
